                <h4>&#60;div&#62;</h4>
                <p>The &#60;div&#62;  tag is an empty container that is used to define 
                a division or a section. It does not affect the content or layout 
                and is used to group HTML elements to be styled with CSS or manipulated 
                with scripts.</p>  
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;div&#62;Name&#60;div&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <div>Hello</div>

            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>&#60;h1&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;h1&#62; to &#60;h6&#62; elements are used to define six levels of HTML 
                Headings, with &#60;h1&#62; being the highest (or most important) level 
                and &#60;h6&#62; the least important one.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;h1&#62;Text&#60;/h1&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <h1 class="example">Hello</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>&#60;hr&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;hr&#62;  tag is a block-level element 
                transferring all the elements after it to another line. 
                The external look of the horizontal line defined by the 
                tag depends on the type of the browser. More often it is 
                displayed with a border, which creates 3D effect.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;hr/&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>&#60;p&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;p&#62;  tag defines a paragraph of text. 
                It is a block-level element and always starts on a new line. 
                Before and after each paragraph, browsers add margin automatically. 
                You can modify the margins using the CSS margin property .
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;p&#62;Hello&#60;/p&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>I'm paragraph</p>

                <h4>&#60;b&#62;</h4>
                According to the HTML5 specification, the &#60;b&#62; tag should be 
                used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;b&#62;Bold Text&#60;/b&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <b>Bold Text</b>

            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>&#60;a&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;a&#62; tag is used to insert hyperlinks 
                to other pages, or files, locations within the same page, 
                email addresses, or any different URL. You can use both text 
                and image as a hyperlink.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;a href="https://google.com/"&#62;Click me&#60;/a&#62;

            <div class="subtopic">
                <h4>&#60;abbr&#62;</h4>
                The HTML &#60;abbr&#62; tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym,
                like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM". 
                Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, 
                translation systems and search-engines.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;abbr title="World Health Organization"&#62;WHO&#60;/abbr&#62;

                <h4>&#60;span&#62;</h4>
                An inline element does not start on a new line. 
                An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;span&#62;Text&#60;/span&#62;

                <h4>&#60;pre&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;pre&#62; is used to insert a preformatted text into an HTML document. 
            The spaces and line breaks in the text are preserved. The &#60;pre&#62; tag 
            is usually used to display code, or a text (for example, a poem), where 
            the author himself sets the location of the lines relative to each other. 
            Text in a &#60;pre&#62; element is shown in a fixed-width font.
            The tag content is displayed in the browser in a monospace font.
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            &#60;pre&#62;Hello&#60;/pre&#62;
            <h4>Example</h4>

                <h4>&#60;footer&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;footer&#62; tag defines the footer of a web page 
                or a section. Usually, it contains copyright information, contact details, 
                navigation links, etc.
                You can have several &#60;footer&#62; tags on a web page. For example, you can 
                place a footer inside the &#60;article&#62; tag to store information related to 
                the article (links, footnotes, etc.).
                The tag can contain other HTML elements, except for the &#60;footer&#62; 
                and &#60;header&#62; tags.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>

                    <li>generic-family </li>
                </ul>
                The font-family property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>

                <h4>Domain Name System (DNS)</h4>
                <p>The domain name system (DNS) gives us humans an easy way to identify where we want to go on the Internet.
                </p>
                <p>A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website, something that's easy for us to remember and type in.</p>
                <h4>Anatomy of a domain name</h4>
                <p>Each domain name is made up of parts:
                    third-level-domain.second-level-domain.top-level-domain
                    There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many 
                    websites use the most common TLDs,".com", ".org", and ".edu".
                    The third level domain is also called a subdomain, because it's owned by 
                    the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website, 
                    like "m.wikipedia.org" (mobile-optimized Wikipedia) or "es.khanacademy.org" 
                    (Spanish-language Khan Academy).
                </p>
                <p>Behind the scenes, each domain name maps to an IP address. 
                    When we type a URL in the address bar of our browser, the 
                    computer has to figure out its IP address.
                </p>
                <p>The computer can't store a database of more than 300 million 
                    domain names locally, so it goes through a multi-step process 
                    to find out the IP address.

                <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h4>
                <p>Whenever you visit a page on the web, your computer uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
                    (HTTP) to download that page from another computer somewhere on the Internet.</p>
                <p> HTTP is a protocol that's built on top of the TCP/IP protocols.
                    Each HTTP request is inside an IP packet, and each HTTP response is 
                    inside another IP packet--or 
                    more typically, multiple packets, since the response data can be quite large.</p>
                <p>There are many other protocols built on top of TCP/IP, 
                    like protocols for sending email (SMTP, POP, IMAP) and uploading files (FTP).
                    All of these protocols enable us to use the Internet to connect with 
                    other computers in useful ways, and to communicate and collaborate 
                    across wide distances.</p>

                <h4>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h4>
                <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, 
                    the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website 
                    that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. 
                    It means all communications between your browser and the website are 
                    encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online 
                    transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
                <p> To understand why HTTPS protocol, we first should know how wi-fi 
                    routers function.Let's say you are at an airport and you are connecting 
                    to the wi-fi which is the property of a third party. Now, when you are 
                    communicating over HTTP, the text is being transferred by their router. 
                    And if I go to a low version of the router, I can comfortably check and 
                    read the text that is being transferred. There could be a password that 
                    I can use to login to your bank site and do a fraudulent transaction!. 
                    Point being - 
                    this is fundamentally insecure. This is called the man in the middle attack. 
                    And this why do we need https when HTTP seems to suffice.
                    Now, to save our data from such attacks, we need to encrypt that data.

                <h3>DNS Types: 10 Top DNS Record Types</h3>
                <p>DNS servers create a DNS record to provide important information about 
                    a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. The most common DNS record types are:        </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</li>
                    <li>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.</li>
                    <li>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)—can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.            </li>
                    <li>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)—specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails to an email server.</li>
                    <li>Name Server records (NS Record)—specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com” is delegated to a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of the name server.            </li>
                    <li>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)—allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address and receive a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).</li>
                </ul>
